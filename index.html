        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociologyüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Alexandra Trujillo and I was born and raised in Oakland, California but I am currently attending UC Riverside. I am currently an undergraduate studying in the department of Sociology. It is something that has interested me for many years and I recently decided I wanted my career to be something within that field. I originally thought I wanted to major in psychology but once I discovered sociology it instantly caught my attention because it is very similar to psych but more focused on society and making changes in communities or certain groups of people.
        The classes I have taken related to my major have really interested me and I am glad I found something I am passionate about. Even though I am not exactly sure what career path I am leaning towards, right now I am considering becoming a social worker. I want to feel like I am making a difference and if I could positively impact at least one person's life, that is enough for me. I am open to other job positions and I believe I will find the perfect fit in the future once I explore my options and build my experience. There is most likely something that interests me or something I am very good at that I just have not discovered yet which is why I am not that stressed about being unsure of what I would want my future job title to be. 
	Economics and business really interest me as well, I am considering minoring in one or the other alongside Sociology. I think if I have a better understanding of the economy and finances in general, I can make more connections to problems or patterns occurring in our society. I also believe they are two fields that would complement each other fairly well and being knowledgeable about both fields would work in my favor. Minoring in something will hopefully give me more job opportunities and more options to choose from after getting my degree.
	Grad school is also an option I am considering because like I mentioned before, I want to have as many options after graduation as possible and getting a higher degree will only help me in that aspect. Truthfully, I have not thought about this as much because I still feel like it is pretty far from now but it is something I am looking into. I want to be as educated as I can and I strongly believe knowledge is one of the best weapons anyone can have and no one is able to ever take that away from you. Being a first generation college student definitely makes me feel pressured to become someone important and successful since I want all this work to be worth something and I want to be able to somewhat pay my family back for all they have done for me. Not only do I want to be someone my family is proud of, I want to be able to genuinely be proud and content with the person I end up becoming. 
	I think I am on the right track and I am happy with the choices I have made in relation to my career and overall improving who I am as a person. There is certainly always room for improvement but I am confident that with time and more experience, I will continue growing and learning. I am excited to see what my future holds and learn new things while developing more useful skills.
